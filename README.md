Web Scraping is define as the process of extracting fruitful information from a web page
by  using  a script which we run on our local machine. 




<h2>Why Web Scraping?</h2>


If we want to extract some important data from a web page. Then it is going to be a hectic job. And if we decided to do that manually. That's gonna take a lot of time and a lot of  resources. In this case we need something which can perform our task very easily and we need to automate this process. For that reason Web Scraping comes into picture. 


<h2>What Web Scraping Do?</h2>


In web scraping we create some scripts and run them in our local machine. Those scripts automate the process of collecting all the necessary data. And give us all of them at a single place in a well structured format. 


<h2>How Does Web Scraping Actually work?</h2>


As we all know that web page is nothing but a set of HTML , CSS and other stuff . Which are written in some sort of sequence. Our web Browser understands that sequence of tags and code and then shows us in the form of proper web pages. 
In most websites webpages code is maintained on the server. To perform our web scraping task we need to follow a proper set of steps. This steps are as follow:-
1. Import request module :- This moduleâ€™s get() function will serve to use the web page of required websites in html format. 
2. Import bs4 ( I am using bs4 module for my project you can use other according to your need and convenience) module:- This module will help us in getting the exact html tag in which the required information is present.  
3. Import pandas:- This module will help in storing our extracted data in a well structured manner. 


  





<h2>Required Modules :-</h2>


You must have bs4, requests , pandas Modules present in your environment . So that the project runs very flawlessly on  your machine and bestows  you accurate data. For which it is meant.
